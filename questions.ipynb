    "1. `def segment(x, space):`: This line defines a function called `segment` which takes two arguments: `x`, the length of each segment, and `space`, an array of available disk spaces on each computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `n = len(space)`: The length of the `space` array is stored in `n`. This represents the total number of computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Q = deque()`: A deque named `Q` is initialized. This deque will be used to store the indices of useful elements in a window.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `for i in range(x):`: This loop runs `x` times, i.e., for the first `x` computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `while Q and space[i] <= space[Q[-1]]:`: This loop pops an index from the deque as long as the current element in `space` is less than or equal to the last element in `Q` (representing a smaller or equal disk space).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `Q.pop()`: Pop (remove and return) the last index from `Q`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `Q.append(i)`: Append the current index `i` to `Q`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `result = space[Q[0]]`: Initialize `result` to the smallest disk space in the first window (or segment) of computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `for i in range(x, n):`: This loop processes the rest of the elements in `space` from `x` to `n-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. `result = max(result, space[Q[0]]):` Here, the maximum of the current result and the smallest disk space in the current window (which is represented by the first index in `Q`) is calculated and assigned to `result`.\n",

The deque only stores indices of elements that are potential candidates to be the minimum of their respective windows. The first element in `deque` is always the minimum of the previous window.

    "# Big O Notation\n",
    "Time complexity in computer science is used to describe the amount of computational time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the size of the input to the program. It's denoted by Big O notation (like O(1), O(n), O(n^2), etc.). Here's what O(1) and O(n) mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **O(1)**: O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set. This is known as **constant time complexity**. Examples include accessing an array element by its index or inserting a node at the head of a linked list. No matter how large your data set, these operations will always take a constant amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **O(n)**: O(n) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. This is known as **linear time complexity**. Examples include looping through all the elements of an array or finding an item in a linked list. As your data set increases, the time taken increases linearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, an algorithm with O(1) time complexity is generally considered more efficient than an algorithm with O(n) time complexity because its running time does not change with the size of the input data set. O(n) time complexity means the running time increases linearly with the size of the input data set.\n"

    "# Sliding window algo\n",
    "the sliding window algorithm is a method for finding subarrays in an array that satisfy certain conditions. The key idea behind this algorithm is to keep a \"window\" of elements and slide this window over the data to consider different subsets of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the problem of finding the maximum sum of a subarray of fixed size `k` from an array. Here's how the sliding window algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start from the first element and add elements to the window until it has `k` elements. At this point, the window is from index `0` to index `k-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compute the sum of the elements in this window.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now, slide the window by one position to the right, which means: remove the first element from the window and add the next element (at index `k`) to the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compute the sum of the elements in this new window. If it's greater than the sum of the previous window, update the maximum sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the window reaches the end of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"window\" is just a way of referencing a subset of the array, and \"sliding the window\" means moving the subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sliding window algorithms are efficient because they do their work in O(n) time where n is the number of elements in the array. They don't need to perform computations for every possible subset, instead, they reuse computations from the previous window which makes them very efficient for solving array-related problems."

    "The time complexity of the above code is O(n*x) where n is the size of the `space` array and x is the size of each segment. This is because for each of the n elements in the `space` array, your code computes the minimum of a subarray of size x. The `min` function operates in linear time, O(x), relative to the size of its input. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the code works:\n",
    "1. The `for` loop (`for i in range(len(space) - x + 1):`) iterates through each possible starting index of a segment in the `space` array. The number of iterations is n - x + 1, where n is the size of the `space` array and x is the size of each segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inside this loop, for each segment, your code uses the `min` function to find the minimum disk space in the segment (`min_space_in_segment = min(space[i:i+x])`). The `min` function takes O(x) time because it has to iterate through each element in the segment to find the minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Then it compares this minimum disk space with `max_min_space` (which keeps track of the maximum minimum disk space found so far) and updates `max_min_space` if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, after the loop has iterated through all possible segments, it returns `max_min_space`, the maximum among all minimum disk spaces of all segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the time complexity of the entire function is O((n - x + 1) * x) which simplifies to O(n*x) in the worst-case scenario (when x is approximately equal to n/2).\n",
    "\n",
    "This time complexity is higher than the O(n) time complexity of the sliding window algorithm I previously described, which makes your code less efficient for large inputs. However, your code is simpler and easier to understand, which might be a benefit in situations where highest possible performance is not required.\n"
